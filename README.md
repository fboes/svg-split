# SVG Splitter

Split a single SVG file into multiple SVG files, each file containing one single SVG element.

This can be used to produce importable files for [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/).

## Installation

Requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Version 16+) - this will also install `npm`
- Optional: [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701) or use your pre-installed terminal

Run `node -v` (or `nodejs -v`) in your terminal to check if you meet the preconditions. The installation of this tool is straightforward:

```bash
npm install global fboes/svg-split
```

Check if `svg-split` has installed successfully by starting the programme:

```bash
svg-split
```


## Usage

You will need to draw a SVG file first. For Inkscape it is best to make all object coordinates absolute by selecting all paths in your SVG (<key>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>) and using  "Object > Transform", de-select "Relative Mode" and select "Apply to each" before hitting "Apply".

Being a command line tool, you will need to open a terminal every time you want to use `svg-split`:

```bash
svg-split YOUR_SVG_FILE.svg
```

This will split up the SVG file into multiple SVG files, and put these into your current directory. It will also generate an `index.html` which allows you to check all SVG files that have been generated.

If the number of objects in your SVG file is odd, and there is a single rectangle present, this rectangle will be used to make an inverse SVG of the SVG paths it encloses. This can be used to build [cookie cutters](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/tinkertip-hole-vs.-transparent).

These SVG files can be imported into [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) - or used in any other way you can think of.
